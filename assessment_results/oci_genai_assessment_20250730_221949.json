  "response_text": "The 2024 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for hypertension management emphasize a comprehensive approach to blood pressure control. For first-line treatment, the guidelines recommend the following medications:\n\n* Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for most patients\n* Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or thiazide diuretics as alternative options\n\nIn addition to medication, the guidelines stress the importance of lifestyle changes, including:\n\n* Maintaining a healthy weight and body mass index (BMI)\n* Engaging in regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week\n* Following a balanced diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products\n* Limiting sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day\n* Getting adequate sleep and managing stress through techniques like meditation or yoga.\n\nBy combining these lifestyle changes with first-line medications, patients can effectively manage their hypertension and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.",
