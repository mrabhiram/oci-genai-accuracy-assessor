  "response_text": "Yes, a 68-year-old on Medicare Part B is eligible for annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) if they meet specific criteria outlined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicare Part B covers LDCT screening for lung cancer as a preventive service under certain conditions, based on evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\n\n### Eligibility Criteria for Medicare Beneficiaries\nAccording to CMS policy, Medicare Part B covers annual LDCT screening for beneficiaries who meet the following criteria:\n1. **Age**: The individual must be between 50 and 77 years old. (Note: This was updated from the previous upper limit of 80 years in 2022 to align with USPSTF recommendations.)\n2. **Smoking History**: The individual must have a history of at least 20 pack-years of smoking (a pack-year is defined as smoking an average of one pack of cigarettes per day for one year).\n3. **Current Smoker or Recent Quitter**: The individual must be a current smoker or have quit smoking within the past 15 years.\n4. **Asymptomatic**: The individual must not have signs or symptoms of lung cancer (e.g., cough, chest pain, or weight loss suggestive of malignancy).\n5. **Physician Order and Counseling**: The screening must be ordered by a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner, and the beneficiary must receive counseling on the benefits and risks of LDCT screening, including the potential for false positives and follow-up testing. This counseling must occur during a shared decision-making visit.\n6. **Facility Requirements**: The LDCT must be performed at a facility that meets specific CMS standards for radiology imaging and data submission to a CMS-approved registry.\n\nSince the individual in question is 68 years old, they fall within the eligible age range of 50\u201377. However, eligibility also depends on their smoking history, whether they are a current smoker or quit within the last 15 years, and whether they are asymptomatic. If these additional criteria are met, they would be eligible for the annual screening.\n\n### Policy Sources\n1. **CMS National Coverage Determination (NCD) for Lung Cancer Screening with Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)** - NCD 210.14 (effective February 10, 2022): This policy outlines the coverage criteria for LDCT screening under Medicare Part B. CMS expanded coverage in 2022 by lowering the starting age from 55 to 50 and reducing the smoking history requirement from 30 pack-years to 20 pack-years, aligning with USPSTF recommendations. The upper age limit was also adjusted from 80 to 77. Source: CMS NCD Manual, Section 210.14 (available at CMS.gov).\n2. **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendation (2021)**: The USPSTF recommends annual LDCT screening for adults aged 50 to 80 years with a 20 pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. While CMS policies take precedence for Medicare coverage, the USPSTF recommendation informs CMS updates. Source: USPSTF Final Recommendation Statement, March 9, 2021 (published in JAMA).\n3. **Medicare Preventive Services Coverage**: Medicare Part B covers preventive services, including LDCT screening, at no cost to the beneficiary (no coinsurance or deductible) if performed by an in-network provider and all criteria are met. Source: Medicare.gov, Preventive & Screening Services.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The update in CMS policy in 2022 reflects a broader eligibility compared to earlier guidelines, ensuring more high-risk individuals can access screening.\n- If the 68-year-old does not meet the smoking history or other criteria (e.g., quit more than 15 years ago or has symptoms of lung cancer), they would not be eligible for this preventive service under Medicare Part B coverage.\n\n### Conclusion\nA 68-year-old on Medicare Part B is eligible for annual lung cancer screening with LDCT if they have a 20+ pack-year smoking history, are a current smoker or quit within the last 15 years, are asymptomatic, and meet the other CMS requirements (e.g., counseling and physician order). The primary policy source is CMS NCD 210.14, supported by USPSTF recommendations and Medicare preventive services guidelines. If you have specific details about the individual's smoking history or health status, I can refine the answer further.",
