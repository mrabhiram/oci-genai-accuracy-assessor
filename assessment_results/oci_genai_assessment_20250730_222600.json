  "response_text": "The 2024 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for hypertension management emphasize a comprehensive approach to blood pressure control. For first-line pharmacological treatment, the guidelines recommend four main classes of medications: thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers. These are chosen based on patient-specific factors like comorbidities (e.g., diabetes or kidney disease) and race/ethnicity, with combination therapy often advised for those with significantly elevated blood pressure (\u226520/10 mmHg above target).\n\nLifestyle modifications are a cornerstone of management and are recommended for all patients. Key changes include adopting a heart-healthy diet (e.g., DASH diet) rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy while reducing sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg/day (ideally 1,500 mg/day). Regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly), weight loss for overweight individuals (aiming for a BMI <25 kg/m\u00b2), limiting alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation are strongly encouraged. Stress management and adequate sleep are also highlighted as supportive measures. These non-pharmacological interventions aim to prevent or delay the need for medication and enhance overall cardiovascular health.",
