  "response_text": "The **2025 SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) rule on climate-related financial disclosures** marks a significant shift in how publicly traded companies must report their climate-related risks and opportunities. The rule, part of a broader global effort to standardize climate reporting, mandates enhanced transparency to help investors better assess the financial impacts of climate change. Key changes and their impacts include:\n\n1. **Mandatory Disclosure Requirements**:  \n   - Companies must disclose **material climate-related risks**, including physical risks (e.g., extreme weather) and transition risks (e.g., policy changes, technological shifts).  \n   - **Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions** reporting is required, with differentiation between Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy), and Scope 3 (value chain emissions).  \n   - **Climate-related financial statements** must include the potential financial impacts of climate risks and opportunities.  \n\n2. **Scenario Analysis**:  \n   - Companies must conduct **scenario analysis** to assess the resilience of their business models under various climate scenarios, such as those aligned with the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C goals.  \n\n3. **Governance and Risk Management**:  \n   - Disclosures must detail how the board and management oversee climate-related risks and integrate them into the company\u2019s overall risk management framework.  \n\n4. **Impact on Publicly Traded Companies**:  \n   - **Increased Compliance Burden**: Companies will need to invest in data collection, reporting systems, and assurance processes to meet the new requirements.  \n   - **Enhanced Investor Transparency**: Investors will gain clearer insights into companies\u2019 exposure to climate risks, influencing capital allocation decisions.  \n   - **Competitive Pressure**: Companies with robust climate strategies may gain a competitive edge, while those lagging may face scrutiny.  \n   - **Scope 3 Reporting Challenges**: Many companies, especially in complex supply chains, will face difficulties in accurately measuring and reporting Scope 3 emissions.  \n\n5. **Alignment with Global Standards**:  \n   - The rule aligns with frameworks like the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** and the **International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)**, fostering consistency in global climate reporting.  \n\nOverall, the 2025 SEC rule is expected to drive greater corporate accountability on climate issues, improve investor decision-making, and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. However, companies will need to navigate significant operational and reporting challenges to comply with the new standards.",
