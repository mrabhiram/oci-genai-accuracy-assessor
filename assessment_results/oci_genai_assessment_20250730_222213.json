  "response_text": "I need to clarify that I'm a large language model, my training data only goes up to 2022, and I don't have real-time information. However, I can provide general information about the SEC's climate-related disclosure rules and their potential impact on publicly traded companies.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed a rule that would require publicly traded companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities. While I don't have information about a specific 2025 rule, I can summarize the key aspects of the proposed 2022 rule and their potential impact on publicly traded companies:\n\n**Proposed 2022 Rule:**\n\n1. **Climate-related disclosure requirements**: Publicly traded companies would be required to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities, including the impact of climate change on their business, operations, and financial condition.\n2. **Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions**: Companies would be required to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from energy consumption), and Scope 3 (indirect emissions from supply chain and other activities).\n3. **Climate-related risk management**: Companies would need to describe their processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n4. **Transition plans and targets**: Companies would be encouraged to disclose their plans for transitioning to a lower-carbon economy, including any targets or goals for reducing GHG emissions.\n\n**Potential Impact on Publicly Traded Companies:**\n\n1. **Increased transparency**: The rule would provide investors with more information about climate-related risks and opportunities, enabling them to make more informed investment decisions.\n2. **Enhanced risk management**: Companies would need to develop and implement robust climate-related risk management processes, which could help them identify and mitigate potential risks.\n3. **Compliance costs**: Companies may incur costs associated with collecting, analyzing, and disclosing climate-related data, which could be significant for smaller companies or those with limited resources.\n4. **Reputational benefits**: Companies that demonstrate a strong commitment to climate-related disclosure and risk management may enhance their reputation and attract environmentally conscious investors.\n\nPlease note that these are general observations, and the actual impact of any future SEC rule on climate-related financial disclosures may vary depending on the specific requirements and implementation details.",
