  "response_text": "For 2025, the **maximum 401(k) contribution limit** for individuals under the age of 50 is **$23,000** (as of the latest IRS guidelines). However, for individuals aged **50 or older**, including a 52-year-old, there is an additional **catch-up contribution** allowed.\n\n### Catch-Up Contribution:\nThe **catch-up contribution** for individuals aged 50 or older is **$7,500** in 2025. This is added to the standard contribution limit, allowing older individuals to save more for retirement.\n\n### Total Maximum Contribution for a 52-Year-Old in 2025:\n- Standard limit: $23,000\n- Catch-up contribution: $7,500\n- **Total maximum contribution:** $23,000 + $7,500 = **$30,500**\n\n### How the Catch-Up Contribution Works:\n1. **Eligibility:** You must be **50 or older** by the end of the calendar year to qualify.\n2. **Purpose:** The catch-up contribution is designed to help older workers accelerate their retirement savings, as they may have fewer years left to save.\n3. **Separate from Standard Limit:** The catch-up contribution is in addition to the standard 401(k) limit, not included within it.\n4. **Tax Benefits:** Like regular 401(k) contributions, catch-up contributions are typically made on a pre-tax basis, reducing taxable income for the year.\n\nAlways verify the latest IRS guidelines or consult a financial advisor, as contribution limits may change annually.",
